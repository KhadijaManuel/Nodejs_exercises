// TODO: Create the routes to an express application.
// 1.Make sure to use the following dependencies within your app:
// a. express
// b. nodemon(as a dev dependency, if you know the alternative then you donâ€™t have to
// install it ðŸ˜‰)
// 2. Create GET routes for the employees and the managers.
// 3. Create routes for the POST, PATCH and DELETE methods. Make sure they are clearly
// shown and explained.
// 4. Make sure to use Thunder Client or Postman to test your API.
